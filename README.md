# Student-Depression-Predictor

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of depression in students using various classification algorithms. The process includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.

Overview:-

Objective: To build machine learning models that can classify whether a student is likely to be depressed based on survey responses and behavioral data.

Approach: Apply multiple supervised learning models and compare their performance using standard classification metrics.

Dataset: The dataset contains multiple student-related attributes which are preprocessed and used for model training.

Project Workflow:-

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing or inconsistent data

Encoding categorical variables

Feature selection based on correlation analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing distributions and relationships among features

Identifying patterns or signals related to depression

Model Building and Evaluation:-

Train multiple classification models

Select the most effective model based on performance metrics.

Models Used
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Ada Boost Classifier  
XGBoost Classifier

Each model is trained and tested on the same dataset to allow fair comparison.

Evaluation Metrics:-

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

These metrics are used to assess model performance in terms of both correctness and completeness.

Required Libraries:-

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn
